For further information see our   Terms and Conditions . 1  C2 Proficiency: Reading and Use of English Part 1 Description  This activity prepares students for the multiple-choice lexical cloze questions in Part 1. The activity raises awareness of the different aspects of vocabulary that are tested in this part of the Reading and Use of English paper.  Time required:   30 minutes  Materials required:     Student’s worksheet (1 copy per   student)     Sample task (1 copy per student)  Aims:      to prepare students for the multiple - choice lexical cloze   question     to raise awareness of the different aspects of vocabulary that are tested in this part  Procedure 1.   Give out copies of the   Student’s worksheet   and the   Sample task . Ask students to look at the Sample Part 1 task from the Reading and Use of English Paper and explain that by answering  Student’s worksheet Exercise 1 , they will find out what they have to do in Part 1.  2.   Allow students to answer the questions in pairs, or to check their individual answers with a partner. Go through the answers together (see   Key ), making sure that all the points are covered.  3.   Explain that you are now going to work through   Exercise 2.   Tell students that they are going to read the text on the Sample task quickly. Set a time limit of approx. 1 minute. Explain that if they find unknown words, they should try to deduce meaning from context if possible. If not, once everyone has finished reading, they can ask other students to explain it and if they can’t, to ask the teacher.  4.   Allow time for students to complete question 7, then check everyone understands the types of vocabulary in the box in question 8. In plenary, ask students to decide what type of vocabulary is being tested in each gap. They should choose the type of vocabulary from the types in the box. It may be possible to argue that there are two answers (see   Key .) Allow for some flexibility here because, for example, if a collocation is very strong it can be regarded as a fixed phrase.  5.   Ask students to work in pairs and to answer questions 1–8 in 6–10 minutes (question 9). Remind them to look carefully at text before and after the gap, as this will help them choose the correct answer. It is also important to read the answers in the context of the whole text when they have finished because this helps them check that their answers make a coherent complete text. It’s tempting sometimes to complete a gap at sentence level and then later to realise that it doesn’t fit in with the gist of the whole text.  6.   Go through the answers (question 10) using the   Key   to highlight how answers should be reached. Make sure that students understand that at Proficiency level, students are required to have a good understanding of all aspects of vocabulary e.g. collocations, fixed phrases, idioms, phrasal verbs, specific vocabulary."

For further information see our   Terms and Conditions . 2  Additional information  This part tests the candidates’ control and range of vocabulary.  •   Each correct answer in Part 1 receives 1 mark.  •   This task requires candidates to select from four options the correct word or phrase to fit in each of eight gaps in the text. This involves choosing the answer that correctly fits the meaning within a phrase or sentence, and candidates may also have to take into account the broader context of the previous or following sentences or the whole text. The texts are from a variety of sources and may be formal, neutral or informal in style. Each text has a title. There is one example answer.  •   Some items focus on the meaning of individual words; this may involve choosing, e.g. ‘leaking’ rather than ‘pouring’, ‘spilling’ or ‘flowing’ to fill the gap in: ‘The roof of our tent was ... ’. In other cases candidates need to be aware of how the word is used in context; this may involve, e.g. choosing ‘interested’ rather than ‘keen’, ‘eager’ or ‘enthusiastic’ to fill the gap in: ‘You may be ... in applying for this job’. In this example, ‘keen’ is wrong not because it has the wrong meaning but because it does not fit in with the grammar of the sentence.  •   This part of the paper also tests fixed phrases, idioms and collocations such as ‘to pay attention to’ and ‘to take no notice of’ as well as phrasal verbs, and linkers such as ‘in case’, ‘as long as’ , ‘even if’ and ‘while’.  •   Candidates should select one option for each question and mark it in some way, e.g. by circling the letter A, B, C or D on the question paper. Once they are satisfied that they have made the appropriate selections, they should transfer their answers to the answer sheet.  Suggested follow-up work  Choose a suitable short text and ask students to write three or four multiple-choice questions of their own."

They should notice the instructions or rubric. Elicit that the rubric tells them what they have to do.  3.   They should notice that they are given a title   Adventure Travel.  4.   The title helps students have a context for the text; and helps readers to be able to predict some of the content and vocabulary.  5.   Point out that students should read the title first to get a general idea of what the text is about. It is recommended that they read the whole text first so that they can start thinking about the text type and overall meaning.  Student’s Worksheet Exercise 2  7.
