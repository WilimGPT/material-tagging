For further information see our   Terms and Conditions . 1  C2 Proficiency: Reading and Use of English Part 1 Description  This activity prepares students for the multiple-choice lexical cloze questions in Part 1. The activity raises awareness of the different aspects of vocabulary that are tested in this part of the Reading and Use of English paper.  Time required:   30 minutes  Materials required:     Student’s worksheet (1 copy per   student)     Sample task (1 copy per student)  Aims:      to prepare students for the multiple - choice lexical cloze   question     to raise awareness of the different aspects of vocabulary that are tested in this part  Procedure 1.   Give out copies of the   Student’s worksheet   and the   Sample task . Ask students to look at the Sample Part 1 task from the Reading and Use of English Paper and explain that by answering  Student’s worksheet Exercise 1 , they will find out what they have to do in Part 1.  2.   Allow students to answer the questions in pairs, or to check their individual answers with a partner. Go through the answers together (see   Key ), making sure that all the points are covered.  3.   Explain that you are now going to work through   Exercise 2.   Tell students that they are going to read the text on the Sample task quickly. Set a time limit of approx. 1 minute. Explain that if they find unknown words, they should try to deduce meaning from context if possible. If not, once everyone has finished reading, they can ask other students to explain it and if they can’t, to ask the teacher.  4.   Allow time for students to complete question 7, then check everyone understands the types of vocabulary in the box in question 8. In plenary, ask students to decide what type of vocabulary is being tested in each gap. They should choose the type of vocabulary from the types in the box. It may be possible to argue that there are two answers (see   Key .) Allow for some flexibility here because, for example, if a collocation is very strong it can be regarded as a fixed phrase.  5.   Ask students to work in pairs and to answer questions 1–8 in 6–10 minutes (question 9). Remind them to look carefully at text before and after the gap, as this will help them choose the correct answer. It is also important to read the answers in the context of the whole text when they have finished because this helps them check that their answers make a coherent complete text. It’s tempting sometimes to complete a gap at sentence level and then later to realise that it doesn’t fit in with the gist of the whole text.  6.   Go through the answers (question 10) using the   Key   to highlight how answers should be reached. Make sure that students understand that at Proficiency level, students are required to have a good understanding of all aspects of vocabulary e.g. collocations, fixed phrases, idioms, phrasal verbs, specific vocabulary."

For further information see our   Terms and Conditions . 2  Additional information  This part tests the candidates’ control and range of vocabulary.  •   Each correct answer in Part 1 receives 1 mark.  •   This task requires candidates to select from four options the correct word or phrase to fit in each of eight gaps in the text. This involves choosing the answer that correctly fits the meaning within a phrase or sentence, and candidates may also have to take into account the broader context of the previous or following sentences or the whole text. The texts are from a variety of sources and may be formal, neutral or informal in style. Each text has a title. There is one example answer.  •   Some items focus on the meaning of individual words; this may involve choosing, e.g. ‘leaking’ rather than ‘pouring’, ‘spilling’ or ‘flowing’ to fill the gap in: ‘The roof of our tent was ... ’. In other cases candidates need to be aware of how the word is used in context; this may involve, e.g. choosing ‘interested’ rather than ‘keen’, ‘eager’ or ‘enthusiastic’ to fill the gap in: ‘You may be ... in applying for this job’. In this example, ‘keen’ is wrong not because it has the wrong meaning but because it does not fit in with the grammar of the sentence.  •   This part of the paper also tests fixed phrases, idioms and collocations such as ‘to pay attention to’ and ‘to take no notice of’ as well as phrasal verbs, and linkers such as ‘in case’, ‘as long as’ , ‘even if’ and ‘while’.  •   Candidates should select one option for each question and mark it in some way, e.g. by circling the letter A, B, C or D on the question paper. Once they are satisfied that they have made the appropriate selections, they should transfer their answers to the answer sheet.  Suggested follow-up work  Choose a suitable short text and ask students to write three or four multiple-choice questions of their own."

They should notice the instructions or rubric. Elicit that the rubric tells them what they have to do.  3.   They should notice that they are given a title   Adventure Travel.  4.   The title helps students have a context for the text; and helps readers to be able to predict some of the content and vocabulary.  5.   Point out that students should read the title first to get a general idea of what the text is about. It is recommended that they read the whole text first so that they can start thinking about the text type and overall meaning.  Student’s Worksheet Exercise 2  7.

For further information see our   Terms and Conditions . 1  C2 Proficiency: Reading and Use of English Part 2 Description  In this activity students complete the gaps in a short paragraph. They analyse the type of words they have used to complete the gaps so that they become aware of the test focus of Reading and Use of English, Part 2. They then complete the rest of the text following a suggested strategy.  Time required:   30 minutes  Materials required:     Student’s worksheet (1 copy per   student)  Aims:      to make sure students know what type of words are commonly  tested in Part 2     to encourage students to think about a strategy which could help them successfully complete an open cloze task  Procedure 1.   Elicit from the class what they have to do in Part 2 – the open cloze task.  •   Part 2 consists of a text in which there are 8 gaps (plus one gap as an example).  •   Candidates have to think of a word which will fill the gap correctly.  •   The focus of the gapped words is on awareness and control of grammar, with some focus on vocabulary.  •   The answer will always be a single word. In some cases, there may be more than one possible answer and this is allowed for in the mark scheme. It is important that students write only one word for each space. The same word does not occur twice.  •   The absence or misuse of punctuation is ignored, although spelling, as in all parts of the Reading and Use of English paper, must be correct. Remind students that answers can be written on the question paper but that they have to be transferred to the Answer Sheet. Answers have to be written in pencil and in capital letters on the Answer Sheet. Each correct answer receives one mark.  2.   Give out the   Student’s worksheet   and ask students to answer questions 1–3. They can work in pairs. Check the answers with the whole class (see   Key   below). Elicit the suggested strategy for doing an open cloze task from the students (see   Key   below). You could write up the points on the board.  3.   Question 4 draws students’ attention to the types of words commonly tested in Part 2. Make sure that students know that the focus of the gapped words is either  •   grammatical, such as articles, auxiliaries, prepositions, pronouns, verb tenses and forms;  •   or lexical, such as phrasal verbs, linkers and words within fixed phrases."

Now refer students to questions 5 and 6. Students could complete the gaps individually, then check with their partner before comparing their answers with another pair."

The students could then give their text to another group, who completes the text with suitable words."

Part 2 tests grammar and lexico-grammatical patterns such as collocations and fixed phrases. Note that the answer to ( 11)   cannot be   business   because that is not the type of language that is tested in Part 2. It could be tested in Part 1.  3.   Suggested strategy 1.   Read the whole text first and ask yourself what it is about. 2.   Think about what sort of word fits the gap: a preposition, etc. 3.   Check for vocabulary – look at the text before and after the gap to make sure that your word fits: is it a collocation, part of a fixed phrase, etc? 4.   Check for grammar:     Does the verb agree with the subject (singular or plural needed)?     Does the tense fit the other tenses in the text or the development of the narrative?     Do you need a word which suggests a negative?     Do you need a relative pronoun to link two parts of a sentence? 5.   Keep re-reading the text to make sure the words you have chosen fit. 6.   Look away from the text and try summarising it in your own words. This may help you to find the answers. 7.   Make sure that you have completed every gap.  4 & 6  0   if   conjunction   Collocates with   even  9   why   question word Note question mark at the end of the sentence 10   after   preposition   Collocates with   all  11   between   preposition   Collocates with   in  12   time   noun   Killing time   is a fixed idiomatic phrase 13   on   preposition   On the move   is a fixed phrase 14   more   comparative   What’s more   is a fixed phrase 15   as   conjunction   As a result   is a fixed phrase 16   place   noun   Take place is a fixed phrase"

Do not complete any of the gaps yet!  2.   What sort of words are the answers? Are they testing your grammar or vocabulary?  3.   Discuss in pairs what you think is a good strategy for doing this task. What should you do first, second, and so on?  4.   Do you know which grammatical structure, e.g. articles, auxiliaries, prepositions, pronouns, verb tenses and forms, or aspect of vocabulary, e.g. phrasal verbs, linkers and fixed phrases, is being tested in each gap?  5.   Complete the gaps with one word that you think best fits each gap.  6.   Check your answers with your teacher.
